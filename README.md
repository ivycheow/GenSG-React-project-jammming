# Jammming App - React Project

This is a basic music app that uses Spotify API to help users create and save playlist in their accounts.

It allows users to log in with their Spotify credentials, search songs by title or artist, add/remove tracks to a list, name the list, and save it to their Spotify account.

## Main Folders

The ./src folder is organized as follows:
+ ...src/components: Holds all the components' files (.js, .css, and images/icons)

## Components

The app is broken down into these pieces:

+ App.js : This is the main component. It holds the maing logic, variables, states, and JSX components.
+ SearchResults.js : Holds three sections. The first one has the user's name and a short prompt. The second is the SearchBar component. The third ones is a Tracklist component that renders the results from the search.
+ SearchBar.js : This is the input field where users write their keywords and start the search by clicking on the button.
+ Playlist.js : This component renders the new playlist information as the user adds/removes tracks from the list. It also has an input to set a name for the playlist.
+ Tracklist.js : This component holds the list of tracks and it's used both in the SearchResults to show the songs returned from request to the API and in the Playlist component to show the tracks currently added to the list.
+ Tracks.js : This is the card tha renders each track information (sont title, artist, album, and cover). It also has a button to add or remove the track from/to the Playlist.
